# waoinfinitywars

To run, make sure you have the proper imports set. Open nox and start WAO Infinity wars in the center of the screen (screen size has to be 1920x1200). Once the game is set up and ready, pause the round, then run the script. Input your run time and pause times.

Press and hold space bar to run the script or 
press r to run the script and hold q to pause the sciprt. I recommend pressing r then when you need to upgrade, pressing q until it pauses and repeating.
Press C to change the run time and pause times.

My best score when I tested it was a .001 run time and a 1 second pause time.

Imports are pyautogui, time, random and keyboard
